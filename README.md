# Final Project
The objective was to practice a number of different things learned throughout the bootcamp course and to act as a pentester and SOC analyst.

- Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
- Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
- Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
- Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.

Read through the [Red Team](RedTeam.md), [Blue Team](BlueTeam.md), and [Network Forensic Analysis](NetworkForensicAnalysis.md)  
View the final project presentation [here](NetworkForensicAnalysis.md). **Note:** *This presentation was created as a group with classmates.* ***However, all other documentation for Red Team, Blue Team and Network Analysis was my own personal work.*** We were only assigned to be a team to bring our findings together to create a group presentation and present together on the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
